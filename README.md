# Lönn Discord RPC
A plugin for [Lönn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn/) that adds Discord Rich Presence support.

**Note: This is currently experimental technology!! By using it, you acknowledge that it may blow up in your face, or not work at all.**

**Hopefully it'll work, but just keep that in mind.**

## Features
Includes three privacy settings out of the box, depending on how secret your mapping project is:
- Show map name and project name
- Show only status (default)
- Disable the status entirely

## Usage
Install it just like any other Celeste mod. On first launch, the plugin will automatically download and install the required binaries (Requires an active internet connection, and currently only supports Windows. Sorry, Linux and Mac users.)

In Lonn, go to `File > Lonn Discord RPC` to see plugin settings.

For manual setup: [download the binaries here](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc/releases/), install as needed.

## Contribute
The project source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/axiand/LonnDiscordRPC/). Improvements are very much welcome, issue reports will be seen if you attach logs.
